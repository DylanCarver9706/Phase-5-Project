ides5 = "The Intel Core i9-13900K is a desktop processor with 24 cores, launched in September 2022. It is part of the Core i9 lineup, using the Raptor Lake architecture with Socket 1700. Thanks to Intel Hyper-Threading the core-count is effectively doubled, to 32 threads. Core i9-13900K has 36MB of L3 cache and operates at 3 GHz by default, but can boost up to 5.8 GHz, depending on the workload. Intel is building the Core i9-13900K on a 10 nm production process, the transistor count is unknown. You may freely adjust the unlocked multiplier on Core i9-13900K, which simplifies overclocking greatly, as you can easily dial in any overclocking frequency.
With a TDP of 125 W, the Core i9-13900K consumes a lot of power, so good cooling is definitely needed. Intel's processor supports DDR4 and DDR5 memory with a dual-channel interface. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the computer, Core i9-13900K uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor features the UHD Graphics 770 integrated graphics solution.
Hardware virtualization is available on the Core i9-13900K, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) will run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, Intel is including the newer AVX2 standard, too, but not AVX-512."
ides6 = "The AMD Ryzen 9 7950X is a desktop processor with 16 cores, launched in September 2022. It is part of the Ryzen 9 lineup, using the Zen 4 (Raphael) architecture with Socket AM5. Thanks to AMD Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) the core-count is effectively doubled, to 32 threads. Ryzen 9 7950X has 64MB of L3 cache and operates at 4.5 GHz by default, but can boost up to 5.7 GHz, depending on the workload. AMD is making the Ryzen 9 7950X on a 5 nm production node using 13,140 million transistors. The silicon die of the chip is not fabricated at AMD, but at the foundry of TSMC. You may freely adjust the unlocked multiplier on Ryzen 9 7950X, which simplifies overclocking greatly, as you can easily dial in any overclocking frequency.
With a TDP of 170 W, the Ryzen 9 7950X is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. AMD's processor supports DDR5 memory with a dual-channel interface. The highest officially supported memory speed is 5200 MHz, but with overclocking (and the right memory modules) you can go even higher. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the machine, Ryzen 9 7950X uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor features the Radeon Graphics integrated graphics solution.
